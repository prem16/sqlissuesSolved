cannot alter the login sa because it does not exist or you do not have permission.

I didn't know the existing sa password so this is what I did:

Open Services in Control Panel

Find the "SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)" entry and select properties

Stop the service

Enter "-m" at the beginning of the "Start parameters" fields. If there are other parameters there already add a semi-colon after -m;

Start the service

Open a Command Prompt

Enter the command:

osql -S YourPcName\SQLEXPRESS -E
(change YourPcName to whatever your PC is called).

At the prompt type the following commands:
alter login sa enable
go
sp_password NULL,'new_password','sa'
go
quit
Stop the "SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)" service

Remove the "-m" from the Start parameters field

Start the service
